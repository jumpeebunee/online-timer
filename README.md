[Live Demo](https://reliable-dolphin-8f21a5.netlify.app). 
The app is a countdown timer. A page that helps you keep track of time so that you don't forget anything.

##Opportunities
You cannot enter a number greater than 99. If you enter 0 or 00, it will automatically remove the values. Automatically 0 if the number is less than 10. The number must be greater than or equal to 59. Added pause, clear, and continue buttons.
